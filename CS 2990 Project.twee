:: AbandonedMall {"position":"1500,900","size":"100,100"}
The group heads to the abandoned, multi-level indoor mall, seeing several aliens amongst the wrecks of abandoned cars in the main parking lot in front of the entrance. Although the aliens are made aware of their presence, since they cannot move while the group’s eyes are upon them, they are aware when there are people in the vicinity. The group somehow manages to get into the front entrance by using the cars.

Arriving at the first floor of the mall, the group decides to spend only one hour searching the premises, fearing discovery by the aliens outside. The group decides to split up, in order to cover more ground - Mulan goes with you, and Abbas goes with Karen.

You are accompanied by Mulan and go to the second floor of the mall, into one of the larger department stores, scavenging for any remaining non-perishable food items and hygiene supplies. However, Mulan drops one of these items, making a loud noise and alerting a previously undetected alien to their presence. None of you have seen the alien yet, but they can hear it walking towards their position.

:: Abbas {"position":"1375,200","size":"100,100"}
You make your way to the reception area, spotting a few other survivors scouting out the area for any nearby aliens. You meet one survivor in particular; a man with light-brown skin sitting against a wall. He wears a rough-looking kufi, seemingly torn a bit from rough conditions. As you walk up to him, he looks up at you from the ground before standing up to greet you. 

“How are you doing? My name is Abbas.” He says as he places a hand on his chest and slightly bows to you.
“I heard we’ll be joining each other in a scavenging group later. Is there anything you’d like to know?”

:: About Karen {"position":"1575,375","size":"100,100"}
As you ask this, Karen looks to the ceiling of the room and deep thought for a moment. “Not necessarily… I was a medical student before everything happened. I just thought I’d use some of my knowledge to help people out here.” Karen says with a smile. “Just don’t come to me expecting me to give you surgery.” Karen says with a chuckle.

Mulan sighs for a moment before responding. “I lived with my husband before everything happened, and I was working at my office when I heard a loud boom, which we now know was the impact of the meteor that let all those hideous things on our planet…” 

She pauses for a moment. “I tried calling him as many times as I could, but he couldn’t answer. I never found him… I guess I volunteered to be in charge of recording what scavengers see on these maps, so that I can maybe figure out how to find him.”

“The like to hunt us humans. That’s all you really need to know. As soon as you turn your back on those creatures, you’ll be as good as dead,” He says sternly. 

“From what we’ve seen, they’d be seven feet tall if they stood on their hind legs, and they have massive claws that can easily tear you to shreds.” Abbas’s voice trembles slightly as he says this. “Don’t forget these evil, red eyes. If you couldn’t tell they weren’t from this planet, those eyes will tell you everything…”

“We plan to search inside a few locations, including a mall, a school, and another abandoned hospital. I’ll be a part of that scavenging group that explores these areas. I heard you’ll be tagging along. Let’s hope you’re as tough as you look.” She says with a slight chuckle.

“To be honest, just stare at them and hope they’ll leave you alone… But that’s usually never the case. They’ll stare at you until you give up and wish for death. The only real way we survive against one of them is to have strength in numbers,” He says seriously. “As long as at least one person is looking at it, it won’t move. One person can keep an eye on it as the other people run away, and we usually repeat that process until we get far enough for everyone to escape.” 
Abbas suddenly looks at you with a stern expression. “Be sure to watch my back and I’ll watch yours later on our scavenging expedition.”

Before you can process, you hear the familiar voice of Karen shouting at the door of the classroom.
“Hey, I need a second pair of eyes!” You hear Karen shout. “One of them’s chasing me-”
Karen gets cut off as they seem to notice the alien in the room. Your eyes widen in fear as you watch from the closet, seeing the alien turn its head towards Karen

Mulan: “Everyone stay low and close we don’t need to be spotted right now.”

Abbbas: “We need a game plan before we start exploring the place.”

As soon as you enter the place there is a disaster of papers full of patients names and stairs leading up to the second floor of the hospital. The stairs also lead up to the roof where the aliens have taken a stance looking for survivors.

Karen: “Okay look this is a huge space for us to waste time going as one big group. I say we split up and find more resources to help us defeat these alien beings. We can split into groups of 2 to make sure everyone at least has a way to escape even if that means sacrificing.”

They have a buzz-cut with one earring on their left ear. They respond, “You can come in. I’m just finishing up here.” They turn to the main and wrap a bandage around his arm before letting him leave the room. They turn back towards you. “My name’s Karen. How can I help you?

You hear another set of stomping from outside the classroom, and it grows louder as another alien crawls into the classroom. You look frantically between the two, but it’s no use. You can’t look at them both…

You struggle to control their breathing and stay silent, clutching the journal tightly in your arms. As you clutch it, the thought crosses your mind: “Why was the person in the closet clutching this journal?...” You open the journal quietly and try to read anything you can see, using a bit of light from a slit in the cabinet door shining down on the pages.

You slowly look back up at Karen, with an astonished look on your face, to which Karen returns. You hear the loud stomping of the alien that was chasing Karen, and you rush past her to try the same thing on the alien. You and Karen watch as the alien stops in its tracks and stares at the piece of glass in your hand for a moment before bashing its head into one of its claws, slumping over on the ground.

Strangely enough, the alien shoved its own claws into its abdomen shortly after looking into the pond’s surface. The journal describes the author gasping as he saw this, confused as to why the alien had suddenly killed itself.

“We should split up to cover more ground. The aliens tend to hunt in larger numbers at night. If we split up, we can explore most of the area before night comes.”

Karen seems a little bothered by the suggestion, but reluctantly agrees, as well as everyone else. You go off on your own to explore a small classroom, filled with chairs and tables that seem to be torn apart as if they were pieces of paper. You see a closed cabinet.

:: Start {"position":"800,350","size":"100,100"}
One days, aliens came to Earth from a meteor shower, plunging the world into chaos. Humanity tried to communicate with the aliens but it proved to be impossible, they only desire they have towards humans is to hunt. The military were unable to stop the aliens, leaving individuals to fend for themselves. As a result, the survivors formed groups and have taken up shelter wherever they could.

After meeting a few other survivors, including the survivors that will be a part of your scavenger group for the day, you and the three other survivors your met set off towards a direction away from the Safe Haven. You all hope to find some materials and supplies, but perhaps also figure out anything else important about the aliens that ravaged the Earth.

The group examines a map they brought, and finds some locations that may have valuable information or resources. 
“Your call, $name, we got four locations that are unexplored. Theres a mall, school, and another abandoned hospital. From other scavenger reports, they both seem to be abandoned and unexplored. Let’s choose one spot for the day and go there,” Mulan says to you, letting you make the decision on which location to scavenge.

The alien’s stomps grow closer, but you commit and hope the alien doesn’t notice. You believe your hopes are answered as the stomping comes to a stop, but you suddenly hear a low growl next to your ear before feeling a sharp pain in your stomach. You look down to see one of the Alien’s claws protruding out the front of your stomach. You look up to see the Alien’s gleaming, pupilless eyes before losing consciousness.

You stay in the closet, controlling your breathing. You decide to conceal your position and watch as Karen frantically struggles to figure out which alien to look at; the one behind or the one in the room. It’s no use however, and you watch as Karen gets violently torn to pieces. You let out a gasp, and the alien lunges towards the cabinet, ending your life before you could even react…
